This project aimed to explore the relationship between education and poverty, particularly focusing on the impact of college education in rural versus urban areas. By analyzing a dataset with 267 columns, we narrowed down to 22 key variables, including education, healthcare access, food security, unemployment, median income, and Gini coefficients. The goal was to provide a holistic analysis of how these factors influence social quality indicators.

Using linear regression and various visual aids (scatter plots, boxplots, histograms), we explored trends and relationships, finding an R-squared value of 0.86 and an RMSE of 1.91, indicating a strong model fit with a healthy performance. Avoiding reductive indicators like median income, we expanded the dataset to include other quality-of-life factors such as food security and healthcare access.

Key findings include:

College enrollment significantly improves social indicators.

While urban/rural classification added variability, it was not always the strongest predictor.

The interaction between education and urban/rural classification did not significantly enhance predictions, but low education levels in both clusters indicated the importance of higher education for poverty alleviation and social mobility.

This project highlights the critical role of a college education in rural poverty alleviation. It stands out for its focus on how educational advancement varies by setting. Throughout, we applied data science principles, including problem definition, data carpentry, exploratory analysis, and model deployment, using an iterative approach to continuously improve our analysis and visualizations.
